# Session 1

## First scene - Intro to Elidria
Read the following entry to the party:


*Welcome to the Land of Elidria. Many factions and guild run the country, with the King, Mages and Holy Leaders keeping the peace and making the laws. The Wayfarers Guild is responsible for all seafaring endeavors, both trade leisure; The Merchants Guild is manages all trade and commerce within the country; The Brewers Guild oversee all forms of brewing, from the humble mundane ale to the most magical tinctures and potions. To belong to a guild is a requirement by law to conduct business within that sector.*

*You all have affilitiations to the Adventurers Guild, though not all belong. This Guild is the most respected, as it keeps the denizens of this nation safe from Monsters, Mystical beings and Magical entities that might cause harm and chaos. Some of you have never met each other, but have all rallied to a notice put out to investigate stories of some troubles in an out of the way fishing town called Saltmarsh.*

*It is late afternoon as three hooded figures enter the village from the east, with the others lingering behind. The figure in front moved with child-like energy, occasionaly stopping to look at interesting things on the side of the road and picking at flowers*

Get Kel to introduce Neridiel, and then interact with the other two characters. As she interacts with each of them, and after they respond, get them to introduce their characters to the party. Once the three characters have all been introduced, proceed with the following text.

*As the three enter into the village, with a salty breeze in their faces, they see a huddle of huts bundled together, with a wide marketplace / highstreet. At the far end of this small marketplace can be seen a few larger buildings. These are likely more important to the villagers and, as such, are of higher quality than most of the huts*

Push the party towards going to the Mayor's office, where they can meet the rest of the party. If they want to peruse the marketplace, they will find that the bakers is currently empty, with people walking past with worried faces. If pressed, they'll let the party know that Kelly (the Baker) has been missing since yesterday, and is well missed (she makes some good bread).

## In the Mayor's office

*As you enter the building, you see in front of you a receptionists desk, behind which sits a bespectacled Gnome on a boosted up stool, with books and scrolls piled up on either side of her. In front of the counter stands another short figure, with a Lute strung across their back*

Get Syd to introduce Valienne and then allow interactions within the space.

Speaking with the receptionist will allow them to know that the Mayor is currently in his office.
She knows a little bit about the townfolk going missing for a few days before reappearing a few days later with a large gap in their memory.
If not pressed for conversation, she will leave to let the mayor know that the party are there.

When she returns, she will start to usher the party up to see the mayor, the final member (Revel) arrives in a flurry of feathers. Once Charlie has introduced Revel, they are led up to the mayors office to interact with him.

When they speak to the Mayor, they discover the following information:

- People had been going missing now for a few weeks, then coming back 3 days later not recalling anything from their time away.
- They would always come back with strange looks and mannerisms that would return to normal in a few days.
- They all had been going to the beach when they went missing, but none of them claim to remember even heading there, and instead going to do something else entirely (seeing friends, family, etc).

The Mayor is worried that people are going to start moving away from the town if this continues, and is willing to pay gold and provide hopsitality to the group to solve the problem for him. Offers 50gp, but will max out at 100gp if pushed. He will suggest going to [the Flying Fish](#the-flying-fish) to spend the night, and gives them a note with express direction to let them stay (and, if they read the note, to bill him for all expenses). Once he has given them the note, he will dismiss them as he has lots of things that he needs to sort out.

*It is becoming dark as you leave the Mayor's office, and the square, market and road are all empty. Earily so. The shadow of the Mayor's office spreads long down the road as it starts to set behind you. The bar is to your left, with some paths leading between the buildings. There is very little noise other than the not-so-distant swoosh of the sea crashing into the beach.*
