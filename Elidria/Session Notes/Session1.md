*Welcome to the Land of Elidria. Many factions and guild run the country, with the King, Mages and Holy Leaders keeping the peace and making the laws. The Wayfarers Guild is responsible for all seafaring endeavors, both trade leisure; The Merchants Guild is manages all trade and commerce within the country; The Brewers Guild oversee all forms of brewing, from the humble mundane ale to the most magical tinctures and potions. To belong to a guild is a requirement by law to conduct business within that sector.*

*You all have affilitiations to the Adventurers Guild, though not all belong. This Guild is the most respected, as it keeps the denizens of this nation safe from Monsters, Mystical beings and Magical entities that might cause harm and chaos. Some of you have never met each other, but have all rallied to a notice put out to investigate stories of some troubles in an out of the way fishing town called Saltmarsh.*
