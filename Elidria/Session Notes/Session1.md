# Session 1

## First scene - Intro to Elidria
Read the following entry to the party:


*Welcome to the Land of Elidria. Many factions and guild run the country, with the King, Mages and Holy Leaders keeping the peace and making the laws. The Wayfarers Guild is responsible for all seafaring endeavors, both trade leisure; The Merchants Guild is manages all trade and commerce within the country; The Brewers Guild oversee all forms of brewing, from the humble mundane ale to the most magical tinctures and potions. To belong to a guild is a requirement by law to conduct business within that sector.*

*You all have affilitiations to the Adventurers Guild, though not all belong. This Guild is the most respected, as it keeps the denizens of this nation safe from Monsters, Mystical beings and Magical entities that might cause harm and chaos. Some of you have never met each other, but have all rallied to a notice put out to investigate stories of some troubles in an out of the way fishing town called Saltmarsh.*

*Three hooded figures enter the village from the east, with the others lingering behind. The figure in front moved with child-like energy, occasionaly stopping to look at interesting things on the side of the road and picking at flowers*

Get Kel to introduce Neridiel, and then interact with the other two characters. As she interacts with each of them, and after they respond, get them to introduce their characters to the party. Once the three characters have all been introduced, proceed with the following text.

*As the three enter into the village, with a salty breeze in their faces, they see a huddle of huts bundled together, with a wide marketplace / highstreet. At the far end of this small marketplace can be seen a few larger buildings. These are likely more important to the villagers and, as such, are of higher quality than most of the huts*
