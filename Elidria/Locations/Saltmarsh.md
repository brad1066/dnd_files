# Saltmarsh

Saltmarsh is a small fishing town, which is known locally for pulling in a good catch with some high quality fish.

Along the right is [Kal Fisher's Fishmarket](#fishmongers) and [Kelly Butchers Meat Market](#butchers). At the end of the market there is a town square. In the square there are 3 main buildings. To the left is [Mark's Cafe](#marks-cafe), to the right is [The Flying Fish](#the-flying-fish), and in the center is the [Mayor's Offices](#mayors-office).

There is a number of seats outside of the cafe that sometimes have people sitting out on them, smoking from pipes and drinking tea and tucking into hot plates of food or sandwiches.

Inside there is an arrangement of chairs and tables, with the far end being taken up by a counter from which food is placed and taken by the lone serving woman [Joan Fabler](#jaon-fabler). Behind the counter can be seen the proprieter and owner of the establishment, [Mark Jackson](#mark-jackson). He manages the various cookers and machines with practices ease. He tends to keep quiet, but looks like he could manage in a scrap.
